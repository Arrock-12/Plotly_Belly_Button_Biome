## Overview
In a quest to find the next meat substitute, Roza is loooking into the diverse biome that resides in belly buttons. She has data from several volunteers that show their belly button biome with bacteria types and counts, but wanted to have interactive and visually appealing graphics to display each volunteer's results. If Improbable Beef isolates a species as a candidate for a synthetic beef, it will have the capabability of identifiying whether that species exists in a volunteer's belly button.

## Methold
- Use D3  to read in external data files like json, CSV, and APIs
- Parse data in JSON format
- Use JavaScript and plotly to create various charts, including a bar graph, bubble chart, and gauge chart
- Use event handlers to listen for changes on webpage
- Deployed interactive webpage to GitHub

## Results

The following are a sample of the charts created for this project. The data is interactive and reflects the volunteer's specific demographic information, biome, and belly button washing freqency.
